## About
This project started as a university project to help lecturers demonstrating the application of several algorithms. Students are not directly in contact with the algorithms them self in this software, although it is help full for the student to know the algorithms before using. This software is trying to teach the way to think when developing algorithms by showing the step by step protocols of several well known algorithms.
